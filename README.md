How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?


Given the above referenced prompts, here is how I would answer them:
  To begin ensuring you are producing functional and secure code, you must begin with a systemic approach of define what the project is intended to do. This should include all of the goals and necessities for what this should be capable of performing, this meaning the requirements need to be defined clearly and understood by both parties. Through this, we can begin identifying the functionality and what are potential security risks that we will run into along the way. Once this has been completed, you can undergo normal SDLC procedure for building your application and following all the proper steps to ensure efficiency is maximized. All of this is made possible through our number one way of getting user needs, Proper Communication. Everything that goes on needs to be illustrated in a succinct way so that there are no questions regarding anything. Ambiguity is the enemy here, there should be completed understanding. These issues can be stopped through multitudes of fashions, things such as; Surveys, interviews, and workshops to get everybody on the same page. Requirements should be a priority when building these things, extra functionality can always be fallen back on.
